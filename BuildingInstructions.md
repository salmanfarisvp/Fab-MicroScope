## Building Instructions 

This Instructions  Go through very minimalist way to build the <b>Fab-scope</b> . 

### Step 1 : 3D Print the Microscope Base 

I met a team from China during the GOSH -Open Hardware Summit 2018, they built an open source microscope as part of there PhD project, paper in [Review of Scientific Instruments](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4941068) . also saw some amazing microscope from the internet, but most of them lack of documentation.

Instead of building the microscope from scratch, I was planning to try out and implement the best one out there and modify itâ€™s and make them better by utilizing fablab and release a newer version.

For the base I choosed [OpenFelxure Model](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope) , (The OpenFlexure Microscope is a 3D printable microscope, including a precise mechanical stage to move the sample and focus the optics. There are many different options for the optics, ranging from a webcam lens to a 100x, oil immersion objective.) 

#### 1.1 Download the Design files and 3D Print without Support

1. [Main Body.stl](https://github.com/salmanfarisvp/Fab-MicroScope/blob/master/res/Stl/main_body_SS.stl)
2. [Optics.stl](https://github.com/salmanfarisvp/Fab-MicroScope/blob/master/res/Stl/optics_picam2.stl)
3. [illumination.stl](https://github.com/salmanfarisvp/Fab-MicroScope/blob/master/res/Stl/illumination_and_rear_foot_5mmLED_L65.stl)

#### 1.2 Assembling the part

I 3D Printed all the required part by support of the OpenFexlure team and utilizing the FabLab Kochi , where I worked . 

### Setup 2 : Modify Raspberry Pi Cam

we are getting the zoom by increasing the focal length between the pi cam and stock lens, for that first, we need to remove the lens form the sensor and add 3D printed optics part in between the lens and sensor. 

> try to use Raspberry Pi Cam V2.0 , other version is little bit difficult to remove the lens and it break the cam , like I did in past

#### 2.1 Remove Pi Cam lens 

With the help of (Lens Adjustment Spanner)[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1574661] from Thingiverse ,first I removed the Pi cam 2.0 lens

Removed the lens , make sure that keep the bare sensor from dust .

#### 2.2 Installing in to Optics Model

After removing the lens from the sensor we need install it on the 3D printed optics part .

next, attach the camera sensor in the other end, this will help to increase the focal length and we can obtain microimaging

### Step 3 : Illumination 

Light is very important when it comes to microscopic images, we are using 5mm LED to give the illumination for our Scope. Simply insert the 5mm LED on the 3D printed Illumination Part .

### Step 4 : Assembling Together
