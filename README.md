## Overview

The study estimates that 5 million people die every year because of poor-quality health care in low- and middle-income countries. That's significantly more than the 3.6 million people in those countries who die from not having access to care.

So we can solve almost all the problem with utilizing technology, As I mentioned earlier based on the report peoples die without getting proper medical attention, and the most of them don’t have access medical equipment to determine the disease , so they don’t know the seriousness of the disease , and eventually it will make big problems . 

Open source hardware has the potential to revolutionise the way we build scientific instruments; with the advent of readily available 3D printers, mechanical designs can now be shared, improved, and replicated faster and more easily than ever before. However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms.
Fab μ-Scope is cheap, open source microscope that can easily build from a Fablab, main goal is to give quality health checkup to poor people and societies to get medical attention when it's needed. 

## Goals

1. Build Fabable Cheapest Open-Source Microscope that can perform the blood test to find out common diseases 
2. Fully Fabable and Cheap cost
3. Automatically detect diseases Using Image Processing
